From Autohotkey website :
AutoHotkey is a free, open-source scripting language for Windows that allows users to easily create small to complex scripts for all kinds of tasks such as: form fillers, auto-clicking, macros, etc. AutoHotkey has easy to learn built-in commands for beginners. Experienced developers will love this full-fledged scripting language for fast prototyping and small projects. AutoHotkey gives you the freedom to automate any desktop task. Define hotkeys for the mouse and keyboard, remap keys or buttons and autocorrect-like replacements.

My use case :
1) Fill Amity's faculty feedback on Amizone : every student enrolled in Amity has to fill feedbacks which includes some 30+ question to rate on scale of 1-5 or excellent to poor. I am too lazy for this to click on 30+ questions and answer them so I wrote script which answers all question as excellent excellent or best, write "Thank you" in comment and then submit it.

To use the scripts first install the latest Autohotkey. Make shortcuts of scripts on desktop or any preferred location. I am making screenshots to assign shortcut to run them without leaving browser window. <br> 
![Properties window](https://github.com/Arthav24/Autohotkey-scripts/blob/master/prop.jpg)
<br>
In shortcut press or make shortcut like ctrl+shift+z for Strongly agree and ctrl+shift+x for agree.
<br>
Now, run these scripts using those shortcuts. Note: There is slight delay between actuall execution of scripts task and call of script.
Voila feedbacks filled in like 2 mins. Pheww time saved :P
